## 🎮 About app
**Who... and What? Detective** is a logical detective game in which the player solves random criminal cases by asking questions that can only be answered with “yes” or “no.” The goal is to solve the mystery by asking as few questions as possible. A better game rating means a bigger reward.
Each object has tags assigned to it for interpretation. The user should ask questions, looking for commonalities and deducing similarities.
The currency collected can be used to unlock additional visual elements and personalize your detective.

## 📝 Self-development
The project helped me develop my skills in **Flutter** and **Dart**, as well as in working on a complete commercial product.
- preparing the full application cycle: code, testing, optimization,
- integrating advertising and monetization systems,
- the publication and verification process in **Google Play Console**,  
- adapting to Google's rules (content, icons, privacy policies).

This experience allowed me to better understand the mobile app publishing process.
